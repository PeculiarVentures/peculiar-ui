# Installation

To install `@peculiar/react-components` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @peculiar/react-components
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command instead:

```bash
yarn add @peculiar/react-components
```

After installing, you need to set up the ThemeProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or `App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```tsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from '@peculiar/react-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button>
        Action
      </Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

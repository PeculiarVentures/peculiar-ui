# Skeleton

Display a placeholder preview of your content before the data gets loaded to reduce load-time frustration.

## Variants

The component supports 3 shape variants.

<Canvas isColumn>
<Skeleton variant="text" />
<Skeleton variant="circle" width={40} height={40} />
<Skeleton variant="rect" width={210} height={118} />
</Canvas>

## Inferring dimensions

In addition to accepting `width` and `height` props, the component can also infer the dimensions.

<Canvas>
  <Typography variant="h1">
    <Skeleton width={20} />
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="h1">
    h1
  </Typography>
</Canvas>

But when it comes to other components, you may not want to repeat the width and height. In these instances, you can pass `children` and it will infer its width and height from them.

<Canvas>
<Skeleton variant="circle">
  <Avatar />
</Skeleton>
<Avatar />
</Canvas>

## Color

The color of the component can be customized by changing its `background` property.

<Canvas isColumn>
<Skeleton background="attention-tint-5" />
<Skeleton background="wrong-tint-5" />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Skeleton} />
